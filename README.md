This is about generating the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study from Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specialises in anti-cancer medications.
Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In a recent animal study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Please refer data analysis and observations at the top of the Jupyter Notebook.
